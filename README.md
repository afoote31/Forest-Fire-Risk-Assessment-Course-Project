# Forest-Fire-Risk-Assessment-Course-Project

Here I've included the code I used for the image classification portion of my final project for a machine learning course I took in 2024. The goal for this project was to become familiar with TensorFlow. I wanted to learn how to use the sequential and functional APIs, data processing pipelines, and the various options like batch normalization and dropout for learning. A further discussion and results of the project can be found on my [blog](https://afoote31.github.io/blog/2025/Fire-Risk-Project/)!
